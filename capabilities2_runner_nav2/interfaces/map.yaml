                    which enables the decision making authority to understand the environment around the robot. This can be triggered with a 
                    '<Event name=map provider=OccupancyGridRunner/>' command. This generally needs to be followed by with a prompting tool 
                    event that allows for transfer of data to the decision making authority. This runner will populate the prompting tool's 
                    execution parameters with the relavent data. As an example if this is followed by prompt_occupancy runner provided by 
                    PromptOccupancyRunner provider, such as '<Event name=prompt_occupancy provider=PromptOccupancyRunner />'.
