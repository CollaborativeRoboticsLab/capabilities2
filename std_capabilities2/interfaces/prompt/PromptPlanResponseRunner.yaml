description: "This capability depends on the prompt tools stack functionalities and allows an decision making authority such as an
              LLM to verify new plan and start the execution at the end of the old execution plan. The capability can be trigged with 
              an command such as '<Event name=PromptPlanResponseRunner provider=PromptPlanResponseRunner/>'. This needs to be triggered 
              at the very end of each plan so that the plan created by the decision making authority such as an LLM can be transferred 
              to the capabilities2 executor for connection extraction and future triggering."
