                    triggered via '<Event name=speech_to_text provider=ListenerRunner/>' command. After listening it will emit a output value which
                    has the format of <Event name=speech_to_text provider=ListenerRunner text=$value/> where '$value' represents what the robot heard
                    as a text. As an example '<Event name=speech_to_text provider=ListenerRunner text='hello'/>'' means that the robot heard 'hello'.
