      description: "This system allows the extraction of the pose of the robot from the odoemtry or localization system. which enables 
                    the decision making authority to understand the position and orientation of the robot. This can be triggered with a 
                    '<Event name=pose provider=RobotPoseRunner/>' command. This generally needs to be followed by with a prompting tool 
                    event that allows for transfer of data to the decision making authority. This runner will populate the prompting tool's 
                    execution parameters with the relavent data. As an example if this is followed by prompt_message runner provided by 
                    PromptToolsRunner provider, such as '<Event name=prompt_pose provider=PromptToolsRunner />'
