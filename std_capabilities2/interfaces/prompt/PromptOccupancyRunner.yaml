description: "This capability depends on the prompt tools stack functionalities and allows an decision making authority such as an
              LLM to recieve occupancy grid data from the robot. This capability can be trigged with the xml command
              '<Event name=PromptOccupancyRunner provider=PromptOccupancyRunner/>'. This will prompt the nav_msgs/occupancy_grid 
              msg in the xml format and would allow the decision making authority to understand the surrounding environment of the 
              robot. Every execution plan need to have this as one of the last and compulsory capabilities to be executed this at 
              the end, so that decision making authority is updated about the latest environment information which can then be used 
              for future planning."
