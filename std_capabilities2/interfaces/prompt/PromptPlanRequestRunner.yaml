description: "The service can be trigged with an command such as '<Event name=PromptPlanRequestRunner provider=PromptPlanRequestRunner replan=false/>'.
              This needs to be trigged at the end of each plan so that decision making authority such as an LLM can be informed to 
              create a new execution plan depending on the state of the robot. This needs to be followed by another event to transfer the
              calculated new plan to the exeutor. An example for that event is '<Event name=PromptPlanResponseRunner provider=PromptPlanResponseRunner/>'.
                Any and all execution plans calculated by this capability need to be within <Plan> and </Plan> xml tags. 
                Various events within the plan can be organised using sqeuntial, parallel and recovery control flows. Sqeuntial 
              control flow means events in the sequential control flow will be triggered one after the other on preceding event's success. 
              Events under sequential control flow need to come within <Control name=sequential> </Control> xml tags. 
                Parallel control flow means events in the parallel control flow will be triggered all at once. Events under parallel
              control flow need to come within <Control name=parallel> </Control> xml tags. 
                Recovery control flow means second or additional events will be triggered upon the first event's failure. Events under 
              recovery control flow need to come within <Control name=recovery> </Control> xml tags."
