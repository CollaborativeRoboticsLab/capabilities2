description: "This capability allows the extraction of the occupancy grid map produced by the robot's mapping or localization system. 
              which enables the decision making authority to understand the environment around the robot. This can be triggered with a 
              '<Event name=OccupancyGridRunner provider=OccupancyGridRunner/>' command. This generally needs to be followed by with a
              prompting tool event that allows for transfer of data to the decision making authority. This runner will populate the 
              prompting tool's execution parameters with the relavent data. As an example if this is followed by prompt_occupancy  
              runner provided by PromptOccupancyRunner provider, such as '<Event name=PromptOccupancyRunner provider=PromptOccupancyRunner/>'."
